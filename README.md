    <Language ID="en-us" />
    <Language ID="ar-sa" />
    <ExcludeApp ID="Lync" />
  </Product>
  ```
3. **To add a product:** Insert a new `<Product>` block with the desired `ID`, `PIDKEY` (if required), and options.
4. **To remove a product:** Delete or comment out the corresponding `<Product>` block.
5. **To change languages:** Edit the `<Language ID="..."/>` lines within each product.
